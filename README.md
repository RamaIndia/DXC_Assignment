# DXC_Assignment
DXC Assignment for programming knowledge

Fibonacci Series have written using Python Programming Language.

Link to run the Test: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/

Unit Testing: Input value passed as user input not hard-coded within the script. whenever executes the script user needs to provide the input value to get Fibonacci Series. If you provide 8 as input value you will get series upto 8 elements examble 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13

Program steps Explanation for more clearance:

1. Created a function called fibonacci_series and which takes input argument as n.
2. Based on the condition it will execute if else statements. If user input <= 1 then it goes inside the if and return as 1 otherwise it will go for else statement and   sum the value of previous 2 elements based on fibonacci formula to get fibonacci series.
3. Outside of the function n is the input value which will get from user.
4. check the condition if n <= 0  then tell the user to provide a positive integer as 0 is not valid input for fibonacci series as it is sum of previous 2 elements.
5. If the input is not 0 then it goes inside else statement. Inside else statement creating for loop to get range of input value(n). Range function used to get sequence of numbers from 0 to n.
6. Inside loop calling the function fibonacci_series with each element one by one until completes with n value.
7. Printing the output which are return from function.
